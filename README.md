# School District Analysis

## Overview
A school board has asked for analysis on metrics that they have received from all 9th - 12th schools in the district. One of the main focuses was on math and reading scores. We worked closely with Maria to deliver the requested report for a board meeting.

It was deteremined that the reading and math scores from Thomas High School, 9th grade, were altered due to academic dishonesty. Maria wanted to replace those grades with NaNs while keeping the previous data intact. Then run the analysis again. Below is a comparison of what changed.

## Results
  **1. How is the district summary affected?**
 
 There was a small drop in Math and Reading Score averages/percentages.
